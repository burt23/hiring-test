## Pair Programming
We've recreated your app in React so we can work through some React concepts together. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the application - we tried to keep it as similar to your Vue implementation as possible, with a few minor "React-y" modifications.

**_NOTE:_** This version does not have the bugs introduced yet - we will provide a new repo link for that portion of the exercise.  
**_NOTE:_** This version also does not have the image carousel implemented. We'll walk through this together. 

### Requirements: 
1. Set up project.
2. Fix bugs we introduce.
3. Jump through our hoops.
4. Have a great time.
